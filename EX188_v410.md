- Back up an image with its layers and meta data vs. backup a container state.


## Run containers locally using Podman ##
- Run containers locally using Podman
- Get container logs.
- Listen to container events on the container host.
- Use Podman inspect.
- Specifying environment parameters.
- Expose public applications.
- Get application logs.
- Inspect running applications.


## Run multi-container applications with Podman ##
- Create application stacks

## Troubleshoot containerized applications ##
- Understand the description of application resources
- Get application logs
- Inspect running applications

As with all Red Hat performance-based exams, configurations must persist after reboot without intervention.

During the exam you may be required to work with one or more pre-written applications. You will not be required to modify application code however in some cases you may need to utilize supplied documentation in order to produce a new deployment of a given application.
