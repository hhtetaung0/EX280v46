# EX288 v410
The Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Application Development exam (EX288) tests your ability to deploy existing applications in a Red Hat® OpenShift® Container Platform environment.

To help you prepare, the exam objectives highlight the task areas you can expect to see covered in the exam. Red Hat reserves the right to add, modify, and remove exam objectives. Such changes will be made public in advance.

As part of this exam, you should be able to perform these tasks:

## Work with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
  - Create and work with multiple OpenShift projects
  - Deploy single container and multi-container applications
  - Create and use a Helm chart
  - Customize deployments with Kustomize
  - Implement application health monitoring
  - Understand basic Git usage and work with Git in the context of deploying applications in OpenShift
  - Configure the OpenShift internal registry to meet specific requirements
  - Create and deploy cloud-native applications for OpenShift
  - Manage applications with the web console


## Deploy multi-container applications
- Create Helm charts
  - Chart.yaml: Holds the Chart definition information.
  - values.yaml: Holds the values that Helm uses in the default and user-created templates.
  - templates:
```diff
# helm create appname

# cd appname
# tree .

# cat Chart.yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: mychart
description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes
type: application
version: 0.1.0
appVersion: "1.0.0"
dependencies:
  - name: dependency1
    version: 1.2.3
    repository: https://examplerepo.com/charts
    
# cat values.yaml

// Downloads the charts added as dependencies and locks its versions.
# helm dependency update

# helm install appname .

# helm list
# helm uninstall appname

```
- Customizing deployments with Kustomize
```diff
// Deploy application with kustomization.yaml
# cat base/kustomization.yaml
resources:
- 1_deployment.yaml
- 2_services.yaml

# oc create -k base

// Apply the deployment overlay to application
# cat overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml
bases:
- ../../base
patches:
- replica_limits.yaml

# oc apply -k overlays/dev

```

## Work with container images
- Use command line utilities to create and manipulate container images
```diff
# cat container-build/Containerfile

# podman build --layers=false -t tagname ./container-build
```
- Optimize container images
- Publish container images to a registry


## Troubleshoot application deployment issues
  - Diagnose and correct minor issues with application deployment

## Work with image streams
  - Create custom image streams to deploy applications
  - Pull applications from existing Git repositories
  - Debug minor issues with application deployment
## Work with configuration maps
  - Create configuration maps
  - Use configuration maps to inject data into applications
## Work with the source-to-image (S2I) tool
  - Deploy applications using S2I
  - Customize existing S2I builder images
## Work with hooks and triggers
  - Create a hook that runs a provided script
  - Test and confirm proper operation of the hook
  - Manage and trigger application builds
## Work with templates
  - Create an OpenShift template
  - Use pre-existing templates written in either JSON or YAML format
  - Work with multi-container templates
  - Add custom parameters to a template

During the exam you may be required to work with one or more pre-written applications. You will not be required to modify application code however in some cases you may need to utilize supplied documentation in order to fully test and complete the deployment of a given application.
